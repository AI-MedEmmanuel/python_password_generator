# 🔐 Pro Password Generator

## 🧾 Description
This is a simple Python project that generates strong, random passwords based on user input. The user decides how many characters should be in each password and how many passwords they want to generate.

It combines letters (both lowercase and uppercase), symbols, and digits to create secure passwords.

## 💡 Concepts Used
- Python modules (`import random`)
- Lists and list operations
- String manipulation (`.join()`)
- `for` loops (nested loops)
- `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`
- User input via `input()`

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. Run the program using Python.
2. Enter how many characters you want in each password.
3. Enter how many passwords you want.
4. The program will generate and display the requested number of randomized passwords.

## 📸 Sample Output
How many characters do you want in your password? 10
How many passwords do you want? 3

Your password is -> 9J@acP%z!L
Your password is -> h#6K1$E^pQ
Your password is -> Bz7&mA*2!d
## 🔐 Note
The passwords are shuffled to enhance randomness and strength. Ideal for generating secure credentials quickly.
